// Next Steps:
// State Management: As the app grows, you might want to look into more robust state management solutions like Redux or MobX, especially if you plan to add more features.
// Testing: Given that you have a __tests__ directory, adding unit tests for the components and any utility functions would be beneficial.
// Platform-Specific Code: If you have any platform-specific features in mind (e.g., notifications), you'll need to dive into the android/ and ios/ directories.
// Continuous Integration: Given your background, setting up a CI/CD pipeline could streamline your development process.
// Accessibility: Adding accessibility features like voice-over text can make your app more inclusive.
